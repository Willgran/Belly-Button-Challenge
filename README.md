# Belly-Button-Challenge
In this project, I created an interactive dsashboard to explore [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Display of the dashboard is [here](https://willgran.github.io/Belly-Button-Challenge/)
