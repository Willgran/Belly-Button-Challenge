# Belly-Button-Challenge
In this project, I created an interactive dsashboard to explore Belly Button Biodiversity dataset[http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/], which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard is displayed here[file:///C:/Users/Will/Downloads/Starter_Code_m14/Starter_Code/StarterCode/index.html]
